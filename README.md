# Kotlin Linter

This project will eventually transform into a linting tool to be used on any Kotlin projects. It will do a few things: 

1. Download all files in a pull request
2. Run [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) over those files (I have ambitions of adding the [Android linter](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) to this)
3. Retrieve all warnings on lines that were added in a pull request
4. Post a review on the relevant pull request
